# 0x02-minimum_operations

This Python script defines a function called `minOperations` that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to reach a given number 'n' using a copy and paste mechanism. 

If 'n' is less than 2, the function returns 0.

Otherwise, it iteratively performs operations to reach 'n' using a copy and paste mechanism. 

The function counts the operations and returns the total number of operations needed.
