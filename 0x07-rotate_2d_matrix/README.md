# 0x07-rotate_2d_matrix

# Function: `rotate_2d_matrix`

The `rotate_2d_matrix` function is a Python function that rotates a 2D matrix 90 degrees clockwise.

## Parameters

The function takes one parameter:

- `matrix` (list[list]): A 2D matrix that is to be rotated.

## Returns

The function returns:

- `rotated_matrix` (list[list]): The rotated matrix.

## Description

The function works by creating a new matrix of the same size as the input matrix, and then populating it with the elements of the original matrix in a rotated fashion.

The function can be useful in various applications such as image processing, game development, and more where rotation of 2D matrices is required. It's a neat, efficient way to rotate a 2D matrix in Python.
